# Final Project: Mapping New York City
By Wyatt Smith and Andrew Gu, in Prof. Katie Keith's CSCI 136 class.

## Overview
We used a Point-Region (PR) Quadtree to organize data from New York City's [PLUTO dataset](https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-pluto-mappluto.page), a database of over 850,000 taxplots (roughly corresponding to individual buildings) in NYC and information on each taxplot's location, address, land use type, owner, and more. With PR Quadtrees, we answered two-dimensional spatial queries, such as "Where is the nearest parking structure to a given point?", and generated maps to make PLUTO's wealth of data more legible to our users.

## Quadtree ADT
Our interface, Quadtree.java, resembles a two-dimensional extension of the Symbol Table, with isEmpty(), size(), insert(), remove(), and get(), as ultimately, Quadtrees are about associating locations with data. However, the interface
